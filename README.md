### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

As a **Lecturer in Computer Science** at **BINUS University** and part of the **Research Innovation Lab**, I bring a blend of academic rigor and practical industry experience to the fields of software development and artificial intelligence. My background includes developing mobile and web applications with a focus on service-oriented architectures.

Currently, my primary focus in research and teaching revolves around **Artificial Intelligence**, particularly in **Game Design** and **Software Design**. I am passionate about exploring how AI can innovate and enhance interactive experiences and robust software systems. I've also actively published international articles, contributing to the body of knowledge in computer vision, deep learning, and embedded applications.

I believe in fostering a dynamic learning environment and bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world application.
